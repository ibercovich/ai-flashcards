I am trying to make flash cards for concepts in the below chapter of a book. I want the flashcards to have a description component and a label component. The description is supposed to describe a label, without using any variant of the label word. In order to chose which flashcards to make, look at the below text and identify terms that are explained in the text itself. Terms are domain specific to the topic of the book.  For the format of your response, return a bash script that creates one markdown file per flashcard, which looks like this:


```label.md
description
---
label
```

Here are some examples:

# Flashcard for Embedding Vectors
echo "Encode high-dimensional data into low-dimensional vectors, maintaining proximity for similar items.
---
Embedding Vectors" > embedding_vectors.md

# Flashcard for Latent Vectors
echo "Intermediate representations of data, crucial in models like autoencoders, optimizing training objectives by minimizing the difference between input and reconstructed output.
---
Latent Vectors" > latent_vectors.md

# Flashcard for Representations
echo "Encoded versions of original data, capturing essential characteristics to facilitate further analysis or processing, used in machine learning.
---
Representations" > representations.md
